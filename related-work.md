## Cache-based side-channel attacks detection through Intel Cache Monitoring Technology and Hardware Performance Counters
Use PMU to record LLC-misses, LLC-references, iTLB-cache-misses and iTLB-r-accesses counts
and apdot anomaly detection (Gaussian anomaly detection) to detect cache
 side-channel attacks.

 No defense or mitigation.
